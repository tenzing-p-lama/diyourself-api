        "detail": "Cut plywood according to the cut list in the woodworking plans with a table saw and fine tooth trim blade. Also use the table saw to cut the widths of the oak boards according to the plans. Cut the lengths of the oak boards with a miter saw. Using a trim blade on the table saw helps prevent chipping the oak veneer of the plywood. However, if you don’t have a trim blade for your table saw, you can make the cuts using clamps, a level/straight edge, a circular saw, scrap pieces of wood, and painter’s tape. Apply two layers of painter's tape where you’ll be cutting after you line up the cut on your table saw or circular saw (using clamps and a straight edge.) Next place a scrap board over the top of the painter’s tape. The scrap board will take all the chips and rips leaving the board underneath intact.",

        "detail": "With the wood pieces cut, it is time to put in the ¼” dado cuts for the bottom of the drawer. Take the one drawer side and one drawer front or back piece and make the dado cuts with a table saw and a dado blade (which is wider than a normal table saw blade) using the measurements in the woodworking plans. If you do not have a dado blade, you’ll have to use a regular table saw blade and run it through multiple times. To do this, you will mark a line using a pencil then make a pass through on the line on the table saw. Next, move the blade a saw blade width at a time until you finish the dado cut at it is ¼” wide. Make sure the drawer bottom is tight by checking a scrap piece of ¼” oak plywood. Be sure not to make the dado cut larger than 1/4”.",

Screw in your 1 ¼” hardwood Kreg screws enough to make a mark on the piece of wood but don’t screw them in tight. When working with Oak it has a tendency to split because it is such a hardwood. To prevent this, predrill some pilot holes for our pocket hole screws. Take a drill and drill bit and predrill a hole at the angle the screw will go into the wood. Be careful not to go all the way through your frame. This will ensure any splits don’t happen as you are making more room for the screw so only the threads on the screw are grabbing the wood. Continue assembling the face frame until all four pieces are attached with pocket hole screws.",

Again use the marking and pre-drill method to ensure no splits happen in the face frame. Once your face frame is attached to the cabinet, you can attach the top to the cabinet. Put some construction adhesive on the bottom side of the top and place the top onto the cabinet. Press firmly all over the top to get a good bond with your construction adhesive. Next, take your finish nailer and 1 ¼” finish nails and nail them up into your top from inside of the box. Do this at a slight angle so none of the finish nails go through your top.",

Also, we recommend adding high-quality wood glue here to make this connection extra strong as it will be the reason your trash can stops at a tilt.

Be sure to let the sander do the work and don’t press too hard to avoid scratches on the wood. Once shaped, follow up with 150 grit for a smoother and more even stain. Wipe away all sanding dust and apply the wood stain of your choice. We used Minwax Dark Walnut stain. Wait at least 8 hours before applying a finish.",

The was roughly 30 degrees for us, which is shown in the measurements in the woodworking plans included. Put something in front of the door to rest it on at the right angle, we used a barstool. Once at the proper angle, attach the tilt stops to the tilt support triangles as shown using your finish nailer, wood glue, and 1 ¾” finish nails. Make sure everything works as desired.",
