Also use the table saw to cut the widths of the oak boards according to the plans. Cut the lengths of the oak boards with a miter saw. Using a trim blade on the table saw helps prevent chipping the oak veneer of the plywood. However, if you don’t have a trim blade for your table saw, you can make the cuts using clamps, a level/straight edge, a circular saw, scrap pieces of wood, and painter’s tape. Apply two layers of painter's tape where you’ll be cutting after you line up the cut on your table saw or circular saw (using clamps and a straight edge.) Next place a scrap board over the top of the painter’s tape. The scrap board will take all the chips and rips leaving the board underneath intact.",

Take the one drawer side and one drawer front or back piece and make the dado cuts with a table saw and a dado blade (which is wider than a normal table saw blade) using the measurements in the woodworking plans. If you do not have a dado blade, you’ll have to use a regular table saw blade and run it through multiple times. To do this, you will mark a line using a pencil then make a pass through on the line on the table saw. Next, move the blade a saw blade width at a time until you finish the dado cut at it is ¼” wide. Make sure the drawer bottom is tight by checking a scrap piece of ¼” oak plywood. Be sure not to make the dado cut larger than 1/4”.",

To prevent this, predrill some pilot holes for our pocket hole screws. Take a drill and drill bit and predrill a hole at the angle the screw will go into the wood. Be careful not to go all the way through your frame. This will ensure any splits don’t happen as you are making more room for the screw so only the threads on the screw are grabbing the wood.

The dresser has quite a few parts, so you’ll want to be sure you’re familiar with them and how they go together. You’ll also be using multiple materials: Oak boards and plywood are used for the parts that show. Poplar boards are used for pieces that won’t show because it’s less expensive than oak. Birch plywood is used for the dresser back and the drawer bottoms. The size and wood species of each piece is shown on the cutting diagrams. By the way, if you plan to paint your dresser instead of stain it, you could use poplar for all of the boards instead of oak.",
